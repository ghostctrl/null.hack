      <h1>Let's Play A Game</h1>
          <p>When attempting an action and the outcome is uncertain, roll d100 equal to or under the appropriate Stat. If you do, you succeed. If you roll over your Stat, you fail and the Warden determines the consequences. Rolling doubles means that you have scored a Critical Success (if under your Stat) or a Critical Failure (if over your Stat). Saves work the same as Stats, however, you do not choose when you roll them. Instead, the Warden will occasionally ask you to roll under a Save in an attempt to avoid some kind of danger or damage.</p>
          <p>If you have a situational advantage (for example, you have a skill appropriately suited to the task at hand, or an ally is assisting you), then you roll d100 twice and take the better result. If you have a situation disadvantage (for example, the action requires a high degree of technical knowhow you do not posses, or you are inebriated or otherwise not in full possession of your faculties), then you roll d100 twice and take the worse result.</p>
        <h2>Combat</h2>
          <p>When attacking an opponent, roll d100 equal to or under your Combat stat. If you succeed, you deal 1 Hit of damage.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>All weapons deal 1 Hit of damage.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Unnarmed attacks deal 0 Hits</strong> of damage unless the defender fails a Body Save. This penalty is removed if they attacker has the CQC skill.</li>
              <li><strong>Explosives,</strong> extremely powerful weapons, and mech or vehicular weaponry deal 1d10 Hits of damage.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Whenever you take damage, roll 1d10 on the Wounds table. If you have no remaining Hits and you take damage, you die.</p>
          <p>Armor adds additional Hits to soak up damage. When Armor is lost you do not have to roll on the Wounds table, however, it is destroyed until it can be purchased again, or in the case of Androids, repaired.</p>
          <p>Some cover may provide additional armor, which when used up, no longer protects the defender.</p>

        <h2>Vehicles</h2>
          <p>Vehicles don’t have Hits, they only have <strong>Armor.</strong> Any time a Vehicle takes damage, everyone inside must make a <strong>Body Save or suffer 1 Hit of damage.</strong></p>
          <p>If the vehicle has no Armor remaining, then it is destroyed and everyone inside must make a <strong>Body Save at disadvantage or be killed.</strong> Those who survive are reduced to 1 Hit and must make a roll on the <strong>Wounds table.</strong></p>
        <h2>Cybernetics</h2>
          <p>Players may install one piece of Cybernetic Hardware (Cyberware) for every 10 points of Strength they have and may install one software program (Slickware) for every 10 poings of Intellect they have.</p>
        <h2>Sleeves</h2>
          <p>Players may upload their memories into a cloned synthetic body called a “Sleeve,” through the use of a Neural Montioring (NeMo) Machine. This takes 24 hours and a successful Sanity save or else the player loses the memory of the past 1d10 days (with a critical failure indicating total amnesia). The “re-sleeving” procedure then takes another 24 hours after which all rolls are at disadvantage for 1d10 days.</p>
